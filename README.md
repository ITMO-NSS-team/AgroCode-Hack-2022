# AgroCode-Hack-2022
The repository contains the data of the NSS lab team for the hackathon "AgroCode Hack 2022". The task was to analyze cow treatment data and to find the most ineffective treatment protocols. The solution will make it possible to take measures to reduce the number of animals illnesses, reduce the farm's costs for treatment and reduce losses from under-received marketable milk.

The use of Bayesian networks and [BAMT](https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/BAMT) framework lead our team to the 1st place. The results are displayed [here](https://hack.rshbdigital.ru/).
